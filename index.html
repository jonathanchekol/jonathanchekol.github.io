    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Emperor Yohnanes I</h2>
      <img src= "Yohnanas I.jpg"
      <p> The Chekol family history started from the Gondarian period of Ethiopia(1508-1784) with the rise of Emperor Yohnanas I.  The emperor was highly religious and was nicknamed “Tsadiku’’ Yohannes. The great grandfather of Chekol Zekele(Azaj Engida) who the ruler of Agaw Midir was a city town located in Northern Ethiopia had an rival by the name of Mahini who wanted to be the leader of Agaw Midir and started to have a plot against Azaj Engida. Emperor Yohnanas I could never take non-Christians in his territory and came up with a plan that he would get rid of Engida in favor of Emperor Yohananas I, which would make him the ruler of Agaw Midir. The plan was to go tell the emperor that Engida had become a muslim and wanted to fight him. He told the emperor that Endiga had been getting ready for war. The signs as told by Mahini to the emperor were that there were no churches in Engida’s dominion, he was boastful and ready for a war and he had been flogging the ground with a giraf (whip) in search of  war with Emperor Yohnanas I. Mahini then told Endiga after he had come back from Gonder telling emperor Yohannes I was coming to get him and if he wanted mercy on him, he should get down on the ground with a whip and ask for mercy. Yohannes I ordered an attack on Azaj Engida, who was not really prepared for a war. Engida’s forces retreated south until they reached what is now Gimjabet Mariam church.  Emperor Yohannes I along with the Gimjabet Mariam Church is the lineage where the Chekol family comes from. <p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Wolle Chekol</h2>
  <img src= "Gash Wolle.jpg"
  <p> Wolle Chekol was born in 1941 in Gimjabet, Ethiopia. Sadly, Wolle's biological mom, Himile Deferesha passed away when Wolle was only five months old. It was a difficult and changeling period for Wolle and his family without his mom. After a while Chekol Zekele decided to marry Mulu Akalu, who had a younger baby of her own at that time and she had breast-feeded Wolle since he was a five month old baby. She never has mentioned that she was a stepmother and always called her mom like other close family members  such as Emahoy Guday(Etalem), Yeshi, Liyew and Tesema.  Wolle grew up as a happy child taken care of by his parents and became a very well-liked person. Wolle loved to learn and he started a church education taught by religious teacher Tesema Jembere at Gimjabet Mariam Church, and later transferred to Gimjabet Elementary School in 1950. Church education put in the fear of God, respect for people of any age, particularly the elderly, truth, love of his people and country in the mind of Wolle, as he grew under the great Tesema Jembere who was full with great personality traits such as faithfulness, loyalty and generosity and played a big role in the young life of Wolle. Wolle was highly intelligent and motivated at an early age, however, he was not able to go to a modern school due to lack of access to modern education in the area. As a result, Wolle decided to go to his grandmother, Amarech Engida’s, house in Injibara where an elementary school was available. Wolle made this decision at the age of thirteen, while his father went to Wegedad for routine trading business. Wolle’s dad was not happy upon learning that his son had gone without telling him.   Later on, his dad went to Injibara to take back his child, but Wolle's grandmom Amarech Engida insisted on keeping Wolle there, and promised to send him to school for modern education.
The period between the late 1930‘s and the beginning of 1940’s was a turning point in the history of modern education in Ethiopia.  The first modern schools began to be built in the districts of Agaw Midir(District in North-West Ethiopia) and Injibara(Administrative Center in Northern Ethiopia) Primary School, which was built in 1938, was one of those first modern schools in Agaw Midir. Thanks to the vision and belief of his grandfather in young Wolle, Amarech Engida, Wolle was one of the first students who got into the 1st grade at Injibara Primary School 1954. Wolle became very active and a brilliant student in the school and the leading personality of his time there.Wolle completed his elementary school in just four years and was a student that everybody looked up to.
After completing elementary school in 1959, Wolle was awarded a scholarship opportunity at  General Debre Markos Negus Secondary(Middle) School. Debre Markos made Wolle the future exemplary personality, well-known economist, politician, international trade negotiator and statesman he would become. While learning in Debre Markos, Wolle became very popular and everyone knew about his educational talent. There was a saying in the city “learning as Wolle does”. Wolle excelled both in his elementary and secondary education, and he was a winner of many awards. In 1962, he completed 12th grade and had high grades for university entry.  During this period, any student who completed 12th grade was required to provide community service based on their selected field of study before entry to college and university. Therefore, Wolle chose teaching and he was sent to Illubabor(South-West Ethiopia Province).
Wolle pursued his undergraduate studies at the then Haile Selassie I University (now Addis Ababa University) and graduated in economics in  May of 1970 with great grades and was awarded a golden watch from Emperor Haile Selassie. Wolle started his professional  career  as a junior economist/planner at the National Development Planning Commission in August 1970 with his former college friend Fasika Sidelil, who graduated with him from Addis Ababa University and Mersie Ejigu  and  Tekola  Dejene who were graduates of Alemaya University respectively. Among those, Fasika Sidelil was posted at the economy section and Wolle was posted at the industry development section of the commission. After Wolle served as a junior economist in the Central Planning Commission, he was provided with an international scholarship opportunity by the government of Ethiopia and sent to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts in the US with his friend Fasika Sidelil in 1972. They pursued their graduate studies in the same field of study and received M.A. in Development Economics in 1973.Wolle would then go on to serve in multiple parts of the Ethiopian government becoming minister of foreign trade(1979-1987), minister of financial trade(1986-1988) and became deputy prime minister(1989-1991). He such as being the co-chairman of economic and technician commission in many bilateral function such as in the Ethio-Italian, Ethio-Chinese, Ethio-Yeman, Ethio-Djibouti, Ethio-Yugoslavia, the Ethio-Czechoslovakian and in the Ethio-USSR sessions. He was also a member of the Shengo legislature government of Ethiopia from 1987-1991.
While Wolle did have a lot of ups in his life, he did go through some difficult challenges throughout his time in government in Ethiopia. In 1991, after the rise of the TPLF government in Ethiopia and the suicidal death of acting prime minister Haliu Yimenu, Wolle along with his long time friend Faskia Sideil surrender after a long stand off in a Bathroom in Addis Ababa  were sent to Alem Bekagn Jail in Addis Ababa.
Alem Bekagn is a jail complex where members and higher officials of the Derg(military) regime were being put into. The jail was located at the place where the African Union Headquarters Office was being built. Poor individuals as well as the Derg officials, lawyers, teachers and individuals with different professions were kept in this jail. In the jail, Wolle played a vital role, serving on the health, budget and work committees and used his experience as the minister of finance to solve many problems with ease. Examples of the problems Wolle was able to resolve included,installing piped water to the prison using his own money and watching how he negotiated with pipeline technicians was a wonderful experience. In addition, he organized the education committee, raised funds and prepared learning materials for the prison community to update themselves. Language courses such as English, French, Russian, and other subjects such as law were taught by the prisoners themselves because the prison had so many smart students in one place. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Alem Bekagn at that time had a large number of well-known and exceptional students who had more  knowledge and ability compared to other  colleges in Ethiopia.
In 2000, after his release from jail,  Wolle went on to establish as a Founding Partner and Deputy General Manager of Afroconsult PLC, Ethiopia. In addition, he became a General Manager to the Micro and Small Enterprise Development Program (MSEDP) Ethiopia, which was a 70-million-dollar European Union funded multi-year national program.

On April 28th, 1976, he married  26-year-old Ayalnesh Gizaw, at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. Wolle would go on to have three kids Meron(1977), Samson(1978) and Helen(1982). Meron and Samson currently reside in the US professionally working in multinational organizations as a Mechanical Engineer and Economist, respectively. Helen lives in Addis Ababa and owns and operates a business. Sadly, Wolle was battling lung cancer for some time and in 2005, was being treated for lung cancer in South Africa and in Addis Ababa. He died on the morning of July 7, 2005 at 6:00 AM at the age of 64 and was laid to rest at the St. Trinity Cathedral cemetery in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Although he is sorely missed to this day by everyone in this family and his many friends that knew him well, Wolle’s legacy will live on. His work ethic, professionalism, self-confidence,  and kindness will forever define Wolle as a model example for this family. <p>

He lived in Gimjabet  with his dad, Chekol Zekele and Mom Mulunesh Akalu and other siblings, Emahoy Guday(Etalem), Yeshi, Liyew and Wolle.  Tesema at a young age was a very curious and smart kid. At home, he would be curious about how things would work at his home such as the radio that he had in his home and he would figure out how the different operations and functions of the radio works. In school, he was a very smart kid getting the best grades and having a lot of knowledge in many subjects. He was so good in school that he skipped several grades while he was at school.
        Tesema was able to go outside of his house in 1982  at 18 and went to Polvdiv ,Bulgaria for college where he attended the Agricultural University of Polvdiv where he studied the results of plant growth hormones for his first PhD degree that he received in 1991.
        In November 1993, Tesema moved to the US to live in the DC-Baltimore area. In 1994, he worked and attended the University of Maryland-College Park(1994-2002) where in 2000 he received  his second PHD in Natural Resource Science(Bioremediation) with his focus being on the phytoremediation of organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs and TNT) in soil and in doctor of philosophy. He also worked for the university being a Faculty Research Associate.  In August of 2001, Tesema became a professor at the University of Maryland Global Campus where he has been teaching Intro to Biology and Global Environmental Change and Sustainability and he has continued to teach these classes to this day. After his time with the University of Maryland College-Park,  in 2002, he then went to work at Battelle becoming a research leader  in areas of phytoremediation/bioremediation and sustainable environmental technologies and served as a session chair at numerous international conferences.
        On September 3, 2000, Tesema married Mulu Aweke at an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian Church in DC called Kidist Mariam(Saint Mary’s) Church.  Tesema and Mulu have two kids Michael (21) and Jonathan(19).
In conclusion, Tesema has had a significant impact on the Chekol family in his work ethic, knowledge, wisdom, kindness, the amount of respect he has from family and other friends and how much he values family are all reasons of what makes him an example to follow amongst the Chekol family.<p>
